# Overview
This project is a GUI-based currency converter application built using Python's Tkinter library. The application takes input of two currencies and an amount from the user, fetches the real-time conversion rate from the ExchangeRate API, and displays the equivalent amount in the desired currency.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The interface is designed using Tkinter and provides an interactive way for users to convert currencies.
- **Real-Time Conversion:** The application fetches real-time exchange rates using the ExchangeRate API.
- **Customizable Layout:** Designed using Tkinter.Canvas for custom shapes and background.
- **Dropdown Menus:** Users can select both the source and destination currencies from dropdown lists.
- **Error Handling:** Handles invalid input and displays error messages.
## Prerequisites
- Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **tkinter** (comes pre-installed with Python)
- **requests** library for fetching exchange rate data.

## Future Improvements
More Currencies: Expand the list of supported currencies.
Conversion History: Implement a feature to track and display conversion history.
Offline Mode: Cache conversion rates to allow conversions even when offline.
Conclusion
This currency converter app provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for converting currencies using real-time data from the ExchangeRate API. It is a great example of integrating external APIs into a GUI-based Python application.
